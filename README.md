Hello everyone my name is Maxim. Welcome to my Git!I have only one mini-project called JaVlasov. In it, I talk about how I study the beautiful Java. I get acquainted with the  basic things and simultaneously do simple tasks to consolidate the material. More detailed information can be found in the repository itself.

A little about myself: graduated from the National Research Institute "MPEI" with a degree in Heat Engineering and heat power engineering. I worked for a year in the energy sector and realized that it was not very interesting for me. I thought about what I wanted to do in life and came to programming. At the moment I am studying on the SkillBox platform and simultaneously watching lectures from different authors on Udemy.

Two certificates from the end of the Java core lecture block from the author Alishev:

One certificate from the end of the Spring lecture block from the author Zaur T.:

In addition to programming, I am fond of playing guitar, chess, reading literature and computer games (for which there is not much time left).

I have a long and difficult path ahead of me in my studies, and only a small part has been passed. Answering the question: "Why do you need this?" - I realized that I was interested in creating and creating something new, and programming is such an area.
